# **Movie Prediction Project 🎬📊**  

## **Overview**  
This project leverages machine learning to predict a movie’s potential revenue based on factors such as budget, IMDB ratings, and runtime. By analyzing historical data and audience trends, we aim to provide insights that enhance decision-making in the film industry.  

## **Features**  
✅ Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
✅ Budget vs. revenue correlation analysis  
✅ IMDB score prediction using machine learning  
✅ Audience segmentation insights  
✅ Predictive model built using TensorFlow  

## **Files in the Repository**  
- **movie_prediction_final.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, visualization, and model training.  
- **ppt_pdf.pptx** – Presentation on predictive analytics in film, exploring case studies and challenges.  
- **merged_movie_data.csv** *(not provided in uploads, but assumed)* – Dataset containing movie-related attributes for training the model.  

## **Technologies Used**  
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
🔹 Machine Learning (TensorFlow)  
🔹 Jupyter Notebook for experimentation  
🔹 Data visualization for insights  

## **Results & Insights**  
- Predictive analytics can enhance marketing strategies by understanding audience behavior.  
- Films with higher budgets tend to generate more revenue, but other factors like IMDB ratings also play a significant role.  
- The model provides insights into potential box office performance before a movie's release.  

## **Challenges & Future Scope**  
🚀 Improving model accuracy with more advanced deep learning techniques  
🚀 Addressing data privacy concerns in predictive analytics  
🚀 Expanding the dataset to include more diverse film industry trends  

## **How to Run the Project**  
1. Clone this repository:
